            <h1> Fashion Transparency index 2021 </h1>
                <h2> What is the fashion Transparency index? </h2>
                    <p>
                        Today companies share their policies and commitments on human rights and the environment.
                        Even if transparency underpins transformative change, there is still much crucial information about the practices of the fashion industry that remains concealed, particularly when it comes to impacts on the lives of workers in the supply chain and on the environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Transparency is foundational to achieving systemic change in the global fashion industry, which is why The fashion Index has been created, in 2014.
                        Without transparency, achieving a sustainable, accountable, and fair fashion industry will be impossible, even if it is not to be confused with sustainability.
                        A lack of transparency perpetuates an exclusive system, where people are expected to trust brands who have continued to put profit and growth above all else.<br>
                        When brands publicly disclose information, it allows anyone to scrutinise their policies, hold them accountable for their claims and advocate for positive change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Fashion Transparency Index 2021 reviews and ranks 250 of the biggest global fashion retailers and apparel brands according to how much information they disclose about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices, and social and environmental impact.
                        The Index is a tool to push and incentivise brands to be more transparent about their social and environmental efforts.<br>
                        The motto of the index is: <strong>"Transparency is a first step; it is not radical, but it is necessary."</strong>
                    </p>
                    <div class="scheme">
                        Transparency → Scrutiny → Accountability →<mark>Change</mark>
                    </div>
                    <h3> The aim of this data visualization analysis </h3>
                    <p>
                        Looking at the data provided by brands it is possible to have a complete insight into the Fashion world impact.
                        Data visualization can help in the comprehension of the index, and it can highlight some aspects related to it. <br>
                        Readers are encouraged to form their own views and opinions on each of the brands mentioned.
                    </p>
                <h2> The overall ranking </h2>
                    <p>
                        Final scores have been converted into percentages and rounded to the nearest whole number. 
                        Please focus on the range in which brands score rather than their individual scores as this gives you a truer reflection of the level of transparency across these large global brands.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        Fashion index 2021 percentage values are represented using bars.
                        The plot is interactive, you can select any of the 250 brands (from one to all) and decide how to sort the bars.

                        <p>
                            Does The income of a Brand influence the possibility to invest into policies and commitments on human rights and environment?
                            Does being fair and transparent help the brand success from an economical point of view? Or, unfortunately, being opaque is cheaper?<br>
                            Here the top 9 ranking per income and their 2021 Fashion transparency index.

                                        Due diligence on human rights and environmental risks, impacts and violations. Please note for this entire section: Due diligence is the process through which companies identify, prevent, mitigate and remedy their actual and potential adverse impacts. Due diligence can be included within broader enterprise risk management systems, provided that it goes beyond simply identifying and managing material risks to the enterprise itself to include issues occurring within their supply chain and focuses on identifying the most salient risks to workers, farmers and other affected stakeholders themselves.<br>
                                        A materiality matrix may be partially based on a companies due diligence process but they do not get points in this section purely for publishing a materiality matrix.

                            In the following plot a detalied view of the values per category, of each brand is represented.
                            Brands are ordered by their final index score, from the highest to the lowest and the color shade encodes the values. <br>
                            Hovering one brand name from the leader board list at the bottom mutes all the others, showing the brand behavoiur in each cathegory, sorted according to the total index value represented in the last axis.

                            The plot is interactive: you can pick maximum three brands you wish to compare from the selection curtains. Each brand is associated with the corresponding legend color. <br>
                            The spider chart for each category of the index is filled with a coloured area shaped depending on the subsection scores. Hovering the area of a brand it is highlighted.
                            Hovering the dots will reveal the precise values of each component.
                            Lastly, hovering the section numbers of the axes, their complete names appears.
